# Hair Dresser Appointment (API)

- It's a Web API enabling seamless online booking for a hair salon.
- Users include admins who manage salon hair services and oversee appointments, employees who set their skills and working intervals, and customers who schedule, cancel, and review consultations.
---
- Followed a Clean Architecture project setup, integrated the Repository pattern to facilitate the separation of concerns, and leveraged the CQRS pattern with the MediatR library for efficient and decoupled application communication.
- To secure the data from the Web API I utilized Authentication and Authorization through OAuth 2.0 and JWT (JSON Web Token) and sent through the Bearer Token.
- To ensure efficient Web API Testing I utilized the xUnit library with the AAA approach for both Unit and Integration Tests.
- The API is used by the Front-End (Angular with Material UI): https://github.com/daviddserb/HairDresserFE/tree/master

- Skills: .NET (C#), ASP.NET Core Web API, Entity Framework Core, Microsoft SQL Server, and LINQ.
